<big>The MBTiles format makes it easy to manage and share thousands or even millions of map tiles.</big>

MBTiles is a specification for storing tiled map data in SQLite databases
for immediate use and for transfer. The files are designed for portability
of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of standard map tile
images in a single file.

## Features

<ul class='checklist'>
  <li class='check'><b>Fast</b><br/> Transferring an MBTiles file is faster than transferring millions of tile images when loading them onto USB stick, mobile device, or when transferring over a network. The trade-off in database access versus filesystem access when using MBTiles is, in our experience, negligible.</li>
  <li class='check'><b>Offline</b><br/> Because MBTiles files are self contained, they can be used without an Internet connection.</li>
  <li class='check'><b>Compatible</b><br/> Images are stored as blob data, so tiles can be read by most SQLite clients. There are many <a href='http://ds.io/phCn8G'>implementations of MBTiles</a> from different organizations -- notably <a href='http://tilemill.com'>TileMill</a>, <a href='http://mapbox.com/#/tilestream'>TileStream</a>, <a href='http://www.arc2earth.com/'>Arc2Earth</a>, <a href='http://tilestache.org/'>TileStache</a>, and <a href='http://mapbox.com/ipad'>MapBox for iPad</a>.</li>
  <li class='check'><b>Open</b><br/> MBTiles is an open-source specification. The specification text itself requires <a href='http://ds.io/r8AtMB'>attribution</a>, but there are absolutely no restrictions or requirements placed on implementations.</li>
</ul>

## FAQ

<h3>Do you need a server to read MBTiles?</h3>
<p>You'll either need a server, or be using the tiles on a device like an iPad. All that a
server needs to do is pull individual tiles out of an MBTiles file and serve them to your browser:
browsers aren't capable of reading the SQLite format that defines MBTiles files.</p>
<h3>Why shouldn't I just keep tiles on S3?</h3>
<p>Originally we managed tilesets on S3, but came up with MBTiles because
of the massive management and efficiency problems that this posed. S3 is extremely
slow for transfering millions of tiny files because each file needs to be a separate
request with lots of communication overhead. When you want to move tiles - for instance,
in renaming a tileset from <code>world-light</code> to <code>world</code> there is no
batch-rename: you need to rename every file individually. In our experience,
operations like deleting tilesets, changing their name, and updating them
were extremely slow given these constraints - often an overnight task.</p>
<h3>Why shouldn't I just keep tiles on a hard disk?</h3>
<p>Most filesystems are terribly inefficient for millions of small files, and
MBTiles can constitute a massive space savings, just by managing them better.
Copying files - which requires building a filesystem node - tends to be very slow,
and high zoom levels can run against <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode'>inode</a>
limits - from which there is no recourse.</p>

## Example
Download the [Haiti Terrain Grey tileset](http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox/download/haiti-terrain-grey.mbtiles). Then, open the MBTiles file in the sqlite client.

    sqlite3 haiti-terrian-grey.mbtiles

Next, run this SQL statment.

    SELECT * FROM tiles WHERE zoom_level = 5;

This displays a row for each tile on zoom level five.

    5|8|17|????
    5|8|18|????
    5|9|17|????
    5|9|18|????
    5|10|17|????
    5|10|18|????

The `????` characters represents PNG images stored as blob data.
