<p><big>UTFGrid provides a standard, scalable way of encoding data for hundreds or thousands of features alongside your map tiles.</big></p>

The UTFGrid encoding scheme encodes interactivity data for a tile in a space efficient manner. It is designed to be used in browsers for interactive features like displaying tooltips when hovering over certain features of a map tile.

## JSON format
UTFGrid uses a JSON object as a container format with the following keys:

<ul class='checklist'>
<li><b>grid</b>: The encoded grid of UTF-8 characters.</li>
<li><b>keys</b>: An array of ids identifying each character with a feature.</li>
<li><b>data</b>: A hash of data containing properties for each feature.</li>
</ul>

## The grid
UTFGrids often look like map tiles translated into ASCII art (or UTF-8 art, that is). Each UTF-8 character represents a distinct feature on a map tile, like a unique country, road, lake or river. And since there are over a million UTF-8 code points each UTFGrid can represent extremely dense, varied data extremely efficiently.

Once the UTFGrid has been received each character can be translated to its feature according to the `keys` and `data` properties. In this example,

- `!` is mapped to `Finland`
- `#` is mapped to `Norway`
- `$` is mapped to `Sweden`

And so on.

## Feature data

Any given feature can contain as many fields as needed as a JSON object. For example, for `Sweden` the data hash may be an object storing Sweden's ISO2 code, GDP, population and a link to its Wikipedia page:

    {
        "iso2": "se",
        "gdp": 337893000000,
        "pop": 9400000,
        "wikipedia": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"
    }
